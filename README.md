# virtual-pet-rock
Virtual pet rock is your cli buddy.
It can tell you wisdom, you can feed it, you can anger him and more!
It may even tell you coding advice!

A work in progress, these features are coming soon.

## How to build?
To build this project, you need cmake and a compiler of your source.
To compile it run ./build.sh.

## Config
All configurations are saved to a file called ROCKCONFIG.cfg
If there isn't one already next to the executable, the program will create its own.

### AI?
Very little AI was used in this project, mainly for debugging. No big chunks of code were written with AI.
